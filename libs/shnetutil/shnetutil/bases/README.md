# shnetutil.bases

## Abstract.
This subdirectorty contains all types of bases and bases approximations required for conducting our experiments. The two types which can be foreseen at this point of time are, real valued FB. steerable bases for DCF bases and later for some complex valued steerable bases for approximating alpha molecules.

## Containments.
	1. `fourier_bessel.py`: DCF bases builder and requirements. (can also later be used for RotDCF).
	2. `bessel.npy`: Bessel bases used by `fourier_bessel.py`
